### **Why**
Job boards in South Sudan have broken data models. Titles mixed with locations. String dates. No filters.

Building the standard: proper types, ISO dates, boolean flags, union types. TS prevents runtime bugs before users in Juba see them.

### **Local Setup**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SanMajur/myjobsinsouthsudan.git
cd myjobsinsouthsudan
npm install
npm run dev

```
